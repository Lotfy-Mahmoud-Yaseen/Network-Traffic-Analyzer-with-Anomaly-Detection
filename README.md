Network Traffic Analyzer with Anomaly Detection: <br />
A Python-based tool that monitors network traffic in real time, analyzes packet data, and detects suspicious or abnormal patterns (possible indicators of attacks or malware). <br />
This is my Graduation Project for my postgraduate diploma in Computer Science at FGSSR, Cairo University.<br />
I take this opportunity to develop a Networking Tool that allows me to explore new aspects of network security and background processes, and to create a useful tool. Also managing a team of four beginner developers, a leader who guides them to develop a useful tool, depending on Academic principles.
