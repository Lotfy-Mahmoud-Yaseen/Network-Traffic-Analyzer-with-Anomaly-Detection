Network Traffic Analyzer with Anomaly Detection <br />
A Python-based tool that monitors network traffic in real time, analyzes packet data, and detects suspicious or abnormal patterns (possible indicators of attacks or malware). <br />
This is my graduation project for my postgraduate diploma in Computer Science at the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Statistical Research, Cairo University.<br />
I take this opportunity to develop Networking Tools that allow me to explore new aspects of network security and background processes, and to create some useful tools. <br />
Also managing a team of four beginner developers, a leader who guides them to develop a useful tool, depending on Academic principles.
